## üö¶ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API key
- Flask web framework

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai_service
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=5001
```

4. **Run the service**
```bash
python app.py
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:5001`

### Dependencies
```
flask
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini AI API key (required)
- `PORT`: Service port (default: 5001)

### Logging
- Comprehensive logging with configurable levels
- Request/response tracking for debugging
- Error tracking with stack traces
- AI model selection and fallback logging

## üîó Integration with MoodSync

This AI service is designed to seamlessly integrate with the [MoodSync mobile application](https://github.com/mayowa-kalejaiye/Moodify.git) by providing:

- **Real-time Motivation**: Contextual encouragement based on user's current emotional state
- **Intelligent Habit Formation**: Data-driven suggestions for improving mental wellbeing
- **Personalized Insights**: Deep analysis of mood patterns and trends
- **Engagement Optimization**: Smart notifications and challenge completion feedback
- **Age-Appropriate Communication**: Adaptive messaging for different user demographics

## üìä AI Model Management

### Model Selection Strategy
The service implements a robust fallback system:
1. Attempts primary model (`gemini-1.0-pro`)
2. Falls back to secondary models if primary fails
3. Provides detailed error logging for debugging
4. Graceful degradation for service reliability

### Error Handling
- **Model Not Found**: Automatically tries alternative models
- **Content Filtering**: Handles AI safety filtering gracefully
- **API Limits**: Comprehensive rate limiting and quota management
- **JSON Parsing**: Fallback mechanisms for malformed AI responses
